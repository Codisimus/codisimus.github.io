			Hi, my name is Cody M. Sommer. I live in Western NY (Go Bills) with my wife, three daughters, and my son. I have earned my bachelors degree at SUNY Brockport where I studied Computer Science. I enjoy programming to make complicated tasks easier, automate tedious work, and create things that would otherwise be impossible without the help of a computer.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			During college, I was heavily involved in programming Minecraft server mods. I often found it more enjoyable to program for the game than to actually play it. The oppurtunity to practice my skills and learn to love programming through Minecraft drove me to right a book to help others do the same.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Though I am no longer involved with the Minecraft community, my other hobbies can be see throughout the software I write. I view most things through the lens of improvement and automation which results in many small scripts/projects related to whatever I'm interested in at the time. Follow me on GitHub/Twitter to see said projects.
