            <h2>Learn the Java Programming Language</h2>
            <p>
              This portion of my site is dedicated to teach the basics of the Java programming language. It is geared towards non-programmers so if you already have some programming experience, you should be able to skip some sections. These articles will not go too in depth but will cover enough to help you understand Java code and how it is written. This is intended to teach enough Java to be able to understand the content of my book <a href="http://goo.gl/z2r6R8">Building Minecraft Server Modifications</a>. Therefore, I will not reiterate topics that are also covered in the book. If you are looking to simply get an introduction to programming/Java by making some cool Bukkit plugins then this will be a good start. If you are looking to learn how to create executable programs then I suggest taking an Intro to Java course or finding something that is a bit more thorough.
            </p>
            <p>
              The text is split into the various chapters/sections. Be sure that you understand a section before moving on to the next. Once you have read the numbered sections you should be able to get started with the first few chapters of my book. Then, as you need to, refer back to some of the additional sections. If you have any questions, feel free to Contact Me.

            Hi, my name is Cody M. Sommer. I am 24 years old and live near Rochester, NY with my wife Ella and my daughter Hazel. I have earned my bachelors degree in Computer Science at SUNY Brockport and I currently work for Thomson Reuters.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my spare time I enjoy programming, making videos/music, and playing games. Online, I go by the alias Codisimus and I am most known for my Minecraft server plugins. I have written several Bukkit plugins including ButtonWarp and PhatLoots. I have also done private work for some large public servers. I love programming for Minecraft and I have even written a book instructing others how to do the same. Sadly, I do not do private work or plugin requests anymore. However, if you are willing to buy my book and try to create a plugin yourself I will try to answer any questions that you have about Bukkit or developing with it.
