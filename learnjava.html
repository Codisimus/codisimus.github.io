            <h2>Learn the Java Programming Language</h2>
            <p>
              This portion of my site is dedicated to teach the basics of the Java programming language. It is geared towards non-programmers so if you already have some programming experience, you should be able to skip some sections. These articles will not go too in depth but will cover enough to help you understand Java code and how it is written. This is intended to teach enough Java to be able to understand the content of my book <a href="http://goo.gl/z2r6R8">Building Minecraft Server Modifications</a>. Therefore, I will not reiterate topics that are also covered in the book. If you are looking to simply get an introduction to programming/Java by making some cool Bukkit plugins then this will be a good start. If you are looking to learn how to create executable programs then I suggest taking an Intro to Java course or finding something that is a bit more thorough.
            </p>
            <p>
              The text is split into the various chapters/sections. Be sure that you understand a section before moving on to the next. Once you have read the numbered sections you should be able to get started with the first few chapters of my book. Then, as you need to, refer back to some of the additional sections. If you have any questions, feel free to Contact Me.

			Hi, my name is Cody M. Sommer. I live in Western NY (Go Bills) with my wife, three daughters, and my son. I have earned my bachelors degree at SUNY Brockport where I studied Computer Science. I enjoy programming to make complicated tasks easier, automate tedious work, and create things that would otherwise be impossible without the help of a computer.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			During college, I was heavily involved in programming Minecraft server mods. I often found it more enjoyable to program for the game than to actually play it. The oppurtunity to practice my skills and learn to love programming through Minecraft drove me to right a book to help others do the same.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Though I am no longer involved with the Minecraft community, my other hobbies can be see throughout the software I write. I view most things through the lens of improvement and automation which results in many small scripts/projects related to whatever I'm interested in at the time. Follow me on GitHub/Twitter to see said projects.
