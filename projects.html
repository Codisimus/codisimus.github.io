            <h2>My Projects</h2>
            <p>
              Here you will find various projects that I've developed which are divided within the below categories. Most of said projects are smalls scripts, simple applications, or even partially developed tools. I have created all of these either for my own use or to experiment and learn something new. So once they've served their purpose, I have no reason to update them further. I am sharing here to offer them as potentially useful tools or perhaps concept code from which others may expand. You are welcome to clone any of my projects or submit a pull request if you wish to share your contribution.

              The first "project" I'm excited to share is actually this website. Web development is not typically my cup of tea, but I still like to practice it now and then. This website is fairly simple in that it is completely static. There is no backend that serves the pages, only the HTML/CSS/JS/etc files which are hosted on GitHub. I have decided to design my website using this approach to serve as a proof of concept that a server is not needed in some cases and free site hosting (such as from GitHub) may be sufficient. There are several "features" of these webpages, such as using CSS styling in place of JavaScript, on which I will provide more detail in a coming post.

              When I first got into programming, during college, I programmed server plugins for Minecraft. While I don't work on these projects any longer, you may find them here.

            Hi, my name is Cody M. Sommer. I live in Western NY (Go Bills) with my wife, three daughters, and my son. I have earned my bachelors degree at SUNY Brockport where I studied Computer Science. I enjoy programming to make complicated tasks easier, automate tedious work, and create things that would otherwise be impossible without the help of a computer.
          </p>
          <p>
            During college, I was heavily involved in programming Minecraft server mods. I often found it more enjoyable to program for the game than to actually play it. The oppurtunity to practice my skills and learn to love programming through Minecraft drove me to right a book to help others do the same.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though I am no longer involved with the Minecraft community, my other hobbies can be see throughout the software I write. I view most things through the lens of improvement and automation which results in many small scripts/projects related to whatever I'm interested in at the time. Follow me on GitHub/Twitter to see said projects.
          </p>
